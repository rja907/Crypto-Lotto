This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is an dApp powered by Metamask, Web3 and React.

Users can access the page, login to Metamask (chrome extension) and enter a lottery.

The person who starts the lottery will choose when to choose a winner of the lottery.

If you want to check it out, go to the directory where you want to clone it and then:

`git clone https://github.com/rja907/Forecasty.git`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Then, go to your web browser and check out localhost:8080.
Let me know what you thought about it!
